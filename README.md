# Hitachi MCU Dumper
Dumper for Hitachi H8/300, HD6301Y0 and HD6301X0 microcontrollers

This project aims to provide different PCBs, for the implementation of the internal ROM dumping system of different Hitachi microcontrollers, developed by Sean Riddle.

A main PCB and various HATS for different Hitachi microcontroller types and packaging are offered.

Original project by Sean Riddle: http://www.seanriddle.com/h8/300/
(Where you can find the firmware, explanations on how it works, etc.)

PCBs designed so far:

- Dumper circuit
- HAT for HD6301Y0 & HD6301X0 with SDIP-64 package
- HAT for HD6301Y0 & HD6301X0 with FP-64 package
- HAT for H8/300 with SDIP-64 package
- HAT for H8/300 with FP-64A package

If you need a different HAT, do not hesitate to contact me.
