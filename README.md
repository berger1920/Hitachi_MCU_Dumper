There you can find the firmware, explanations on how it works, etc.

PCBs designed so far:

- Dumper circuit
- HAT for HD6301Y0 & HD6301X0 with SDIP-64 package
- HAT for HD6301Y0 & HD6301X0 with FP-64 package
- HAT for H8/300 with SDIP-64 package
- HAT for H8/300 with FP-64A package

If you need a different HAT, do not hesitate to contact me.
